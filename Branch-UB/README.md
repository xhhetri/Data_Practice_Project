# AI-Powered Decision Support System — Transport Emissions (Australia)

Predictive analytics on Australian transport-sector emissions, built
from seven public government datasets: cleaning, EDA, and
forecasting/regression models over a single, flat pipeline.

> **Scope note:** this project was originally framed as "road transport
> emissions." The published state-level emissions data only breaks down
> to whole transport sector (road + rail + domestic aviation + shipping
> combined) — there's no further mode split at that granularity in the
> real data. Rather than claim road-specific results the data can't
> support, the project's scope was renamed to match what's actually
> measurable. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full reasoning.

## Status

**Real government data is loaded and verified working.** All 7 sources
in scope currently resolve to real downloaded files (see
[Data sources](#data-sources)).

**Implemented and verified end-to-end:**

- Data loading + cleaning for all 7 sources, real-file-aware
  (`src/analysis/clean.py`)
- Merged, analysis-ready tables (annual state-level, monthly fuel series)
- Exploratory data analysis — 6 figures (`src/analysis/eda.py`)
- Two models — annual emissions regression, monthly fuel forecast
  (`src/analysis/model.py`)
- Data quality validation — emission-factor cross-check
  (`src/analysis/validate.py`)
- 24 automated tests (`tests/test_clean.py`, run with `pytest tests/`)
- CI on every push/PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Single command to run the whole pipeline (`run_pipeline.py`)
- Architecture and workflow diagrams (`docs/`)

**Explicitly out of scope** — see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for why:

- Layered Bronze/Silver/Gold warehouse, Streamlit dashboard, FastAPI
  endpoint, `src/ingest/` connector layer — all descoped.
- **National GHG Accounts OData API and NSW Traffic Volume Counts** —
  descoped. Never had a real data pull wired in; removed from the
  pipeline, tests, and diagrams rather than kept as an undocumented
  half-feature. Not a gap to fill later — a deliberate scope decision.

## What running on real data actually showed

The regression (fuel + VKT + vehicles → transport-sector emissions)
scores **CV R² ≈ 0.995** on real data. That is expected, not a triumph
to celebrate uncritically: state emissions inventories are *constructed
from* fuel sales via published NGA emission factors, so a near-perfect
score here mostly reflects that accounting identity, not a novel
predictive insight.

The **fuel forecast** is the model actually worth trusting: MAPE ≈3.8%
on real monthly petroleum sales, since Holt-Winters is fitting genuine
seasonal structure.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

pytest tests/          # 24 tests, ~2 min
python run_pipeline.py  # clean -> EDA -> model -> validate
```

Every pipeline run logs, per source, whether it used real data or a
fixture — check this before citing any number:

## Data sources

| # | Source                                                   | Loader                           | Used by                                                                             |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Australian Petroleum Statistics                          | `load_petroleum_statistics()`  | annual master, monthly forecast, validation                                         |
| 2 | State & Territory GHG Inventories (Emission Data Tables) | `load_state_territory_ghg()`   | annual master (regression target), validation                                       |

| 5 | Registered Road Vehicles                                 | `load_vehicle_registrations()` | annual master (genuine annual series, sourced from the BITRE Yearbook — see below) |
| 6 | Quarterly GHG Update                                     | `load_quarterly_ghg_update()`  | loaded, not merged — no state dimension exists in this source                      |
| 7 | ABS Population (ERP)                                     | `load_population()`            | annual master with population                                                       |

Note: source 5's real data comes from the *same physical file* as
source 4 (the BITRE Yearbook workbook) — `Table 4.3` for VKT, `Table 4.6b` (inside the combined `Table 4.6a-c` sheet) for vehicle stock by
state. `load_vehicle_registrations()` locates the `bitre_yearbook` file
directly rather than a separate `vehicle_registrations` file for this
reason.

All real files currently live under human-named folders (whatever the
person who downloaded them called it), not the canonical `source_name`
keys — e.g. `data/bronze/Australian Petroleum statistics consumption cover/`. `clean.py`'s `BRONZE_FOLDER_ALIASES` maps every folder name
we've seen used to its canonical source; add to that dict if a new
folder name shows up rather than renaming folders to match.

## Real-data caveats — read before writing these into the report

1. **Emissions = whole transport sector, not road-only** — the reason
   for the project rename. The Emission Data Tables' finest state-level
   breakdown is `"3. Transport"` — road + rail + domestic aviation +
   shipping combined. No further mode split exists at state level in
   this published source.
2. **ACT has no state-level fuel sales data.** Confirmed against the raw
   source file's own `State` column — not a parsing gap. `annual_master`
   covers 7 states, not 8.
3. **The emission-factor validation gap (~30%) is expected.**
   `validate_emission_factors()` compares *road-fuel-only* implied
   emissions against the *whole-transport-sector* reported figure (see
   caveat 1) — implied should run lower, roughly in proportion to
   road's share of transport fuel use.

## Analysis-ready tables

Built by `clean.py`, aligned to Australian financial year (labelled by
its start year, e.g. "2020" = FY2020-21):

- **`annual_master.csv`** — fuel consumption, road VKT, registered
  vehicles, and transport-sector emissions (the regression target).
  Currently 98 rows: 7 states × 2010–2023.
- **`annual_master_with_population.csv`** — adds population and
  per-capita features.
- **`monthly_fuel_series.csv`** — the fuel forecasting target, ~190
  monthly points per state.

## Models

**`fit_emissions_regression()`** — linear regression and random
forest, 5-fold cross-validated. Reports CV R², CV MAE, and random-forest
feature importances.

**`forecast_fuel_consumption(state, test_months)`** — Holt-Winters
exponential smoothing with a seasonal-naive fallback if `statsmodels`
fails (happened on one teammate's environment — a real `statsmodels`
bug, fixed by upgrading to ≥0.15.0, see `requirements.txt`). `run()`
calls this once per state (all 7), not just one — results land in
`metrics.json` as `fuel_forecast_NSW`, `fuel_forecast_VIC`, etc., and
each gets its own chart (`reports/figures/06_forecast_<STATE>.png`).

> Every model result's `_caveat` field is generated at runtime, not
> hardcoded — check that run's "Using real data" / "Using sample data"
> log lines for the actual answer on whether real or fixture data
> produced a given number.

## Data quality validation

`src/analysis/validate.py` — **`validate_emission_factors()`**: fuel ×
published NGA factor vs. reported emissions. See caveat 4 above for why
a ~30% gap is expected, not a bug.

(A second check, comparing this data against a National Greenhouse
Accounts OData API pull, previously existed here. Removed along with
that data source — see CHANGELOG.md.)

## Dashboard

`dashboard/index.html` — an interactive dashboard, self-contained
(Plotly bundled locally as `dashboard/plotly.min.js`, no CDN, no
internet needed, no server — open the file directly in a browser).

- **Historical trends** — Transport-sector emissions, fuel consumption,
  VKT, registered vehicles, and both per-capita views, switchable via
  the metric dropdown, by state.
- **Per-state controls** — show/hide any state, recolor any line via
  the color swatch. Every panel below (monthly fuel, forecast bars)
  shares the same state selection and colors.
- **Monthly fuel consumption** — the real ~190-point-per-state series,
  not just the annual aggregate.
- **Models** — regression CV R²/MAE, a forecast-accuracy bar chart per
  state, and a detail view (train / actual / forecast) for any one
  state's fuel forecast.
- **Validation** — the emission-factor check as an interactive scatter.

Every caveat from this README (CV R² near 1 being expected, not a
predictive triumph; the ~30% validation gap being explained by
road-fuel-only vs. whole-transport-sector scope) is shown directly in
the dashboard, not just documented here — a marker or teammate looking
at the dashboard alone still gets the honest interpretation, not just
the chart.

Regenerate after any pipeline change:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py && python scripts/build_dashboard.py
```

`dashboard/template.html` is the source (HTML/CSS/JS); `build_dashboard.py`
reads the real processed data and injects it as embedded JSON — nothing
is fetched at runtime, so there's no CORS/network dependency when
someone just opens the file.

## Notebook

`src/analysis/analysis.ipynb` — same results as the pipeline, displayed
inline as well as saved. Calls the exact same functions in
`clean.py`/`eda.py`/`model.py`/`validate.py` directly, so there's no
duplicated plotting logic — running it also writes to `reports/`, same
as `python run_pipeline.py` does. Open it in Jupyter and run all cells.

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

24 tests. Master-table shape tests check structure (row count > 0, valid
state codes, no nulls, positive values) rather than exact numbers, since
`_locate()` prefers real data whenever present and the real row counts
differ from the fixture-only case.

## Continuous Integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR: installs
`requirements.txt`, runs tests, runs the full pipeline, uploads outputs
as a build artifact.

## Diagrams

`docs/architecture/architecture_v3.png` and
`docs/workflow/workflow_v3.png` — v3 reflects the transport-emissions
rename and the 7-source scope. Earlier versions kept in `docs/` as
historical record, not deleted. Regenerate with:

```bash
python scripts/generate_diagrams.py
```

feat(clean): parse real petroleum sales sheet, road-fuel products only
fix(validate): align fuel to financial year before comparing to emissions
docs(readme): rename project scope to transport emissions
```

### PR workflow

1. `git checkout main && git pull`
2. `git checkout -b feature/<epic>-<task>`
3. Commit in small chunks, not one batch per epic — this matters for
   Assessment 2 Section 4, where each teammate links their own commits
4. Push early, open a draft PR for visibility
5. One approving review before merge
6. Squash-merge into `main`, delete the branch
